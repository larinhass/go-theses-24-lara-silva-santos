			<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
			<p>
				I wish good meetings to everyone who will read this text, may the words be alive and fruitful. Let this
				text be placed on the ground. May it mark once and for all my enchanted territory, the known body. I
				chose to write it so I remember it. For the opposite of this, is disenchantment, it means conforming to
				the countless stories told about my body intending to dominate it, civilize it, and silence it.
			</p>
			<p>
				About reminders for me, motivations for doing this: for a long time I practiced neglecting the body,
				that is, I left my body aside, until it became super difficult to hear it, even to know it. This dynamic
				is a problem that affects many people. In my story, I see that this distancing from the body was
				conducted within different structures, reinforcing lies and universal formulas of sanctity, progress,
				and civilization.
			</p>
			<p>
				Introducing the body that speaks to you, I am Lara Santos, a black, Brazilian, and queer woman, I am a
				multidisciplinary graphic designer, who strategically deals with graphic design as a tool to bring
				together bodies, to record and publish their knowledge. It is important to highlight that singularity is
				a fundamental point here, considering a movement against homogenization.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a way around these lies told about the body. This piece of writing reflects on how the body is
				in confrontation with choreographies of social norms that say the body needs to be contained, and
				controlled. The schism is what is the body's repertoire. If the body speaks, what are the relationships
				between the body and graphic design?
			</p>

			<p>So let's go. May I be filled with the desire to write, may I be able to awaken what has been dormant
				over time. May here be nothing more than the lifelong authorization to say words without fear of the
				language not being formatted for everyone's understanding. May the word and the body not be separated
				for communication.
			</p>

			<p>

				Below I present to whoever is reading, the path of my curiosity between the body and its knowledge,
				concerning words, and graphic design. I expose the path of becoming aware of how both transport
				epistemes, that is, they transport knowledge. I write through references, to authors, artists,
				designers, interviews, and experiences, which inspired me in my positions and gave me the procedure to
				write here. I thank and honor each name mentioned here. Maximum respect and affection for the knowledge
				of the people I mention in this text. May we have open chests for this journey!

			<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

			<p> At this moment I am reflecting on how to bring the body to the center, by which I mean that
				my curiosity is to see through a lens that sees the body as a protagonist, a collection, a healer, a
				communicator. I seek to raise awareness of the repertoire of embodied knowledge so that it is possible
				to recognize, play, and fight with it in our daily lives. <br>
				<br>
				I want to make it clear that the body here travels in different dimensions, it can be the body as a
				physical, carnal apparatus. Body that lived on this ground that we walk on now, and is today crossed by
				history. Another possible dimension here is the body as memory, the body, which contains knowledge and
				expresses it. The collective body is a body that shares experiences with its network, which is in
				relationship with itself, with others, and with its context. The body image is the image, aesthetics,
				that creates images. Which is a thinking image, and which is in constant displacement, in flux.

					<h3 id="intro">Body and memory: the head – the silencing</h2>
				</summary>

				<p>
					Let's think about the memories inscribed in the body. But be careful, because, unlike Western
					traditions that emphasize the recording of memory strictly through words. Here, based on the writer
					Leda Maria Martins as a reference, I welcome the notions, which are in her work, which recognize the
					body with all its variety of knowledge as significant in the inscription, production, and
					dissemination of knowledge. Mastery of an alphabetically written language is not decisive for the
					inscription of knowledge.<br>
					<br>
					After all, access to written discursive language is a privilege, and for a long time it was a tool
					used by the hegemonic social class in the service of its self-promotion, domination, invested in the
					disqualification of other ways of establishing knowledge, among them those that are conducted by
					corporeality.<br>
					<br>

					African bodies displaced to the Americas expressed their knowledge primarily through bodily
					performances. As Leda Maria Martins would say, in her book Performances do Tempo Espiralar: poéticas
					do corpo-tela, "the word was danced, the gesture was sung, in every movement a choreography of the
					voice resonated, a score of diction, a graffiti pigmentation of the skin, a sound of colors".<br>
					<br>

					I praise such languages, as they symbolize resistance and resilience in preserving the cultural
					memory of a people. Such performances: dances, rites, songs, gestures, images, orality, and
					drumming, are sacred movements to get to know oneself, connect, and be enchanted. As stated before,
					this knowledge seems to be constantly under attack from emptying, erasure, and silencing.<br>

					The social class that represents the colonizers in the Americas, whiteness, during and after the
					colonial period, mounted different attacks on the African and Indigenous bodies, through the most
					diverse tools of domination. For example, the religion that made rites - sins, the laws that
					prohibited samba and capoeira. The police who killed us and continue to kill us, taking the lives of
					our children. The manipulation of history authorizes the illusory narrative of white sovereignty,
					which does not point to itself, but is based on pointing to "others" to maintain its status quo.
					However, I do not propose to enter into that discussion here.
				</p>
				<p>
					"The body is a place of memory, and in it are inscribed the experiences lived and updated in
					everyday life. The body as a totality of knowledge, perceived integrally, was abandoned and split,
					de-interlaced from the brain for a long time. The aphorism “I think therefore I am” leaves deep
					marks on our imagination about the body, making us believe that the body is not a way of thinking,
					that the body “does not know.” -Luciane Ramos Silva

				</p>

			</details>

			<p>
				The unconditional value of rationalism here has to be intentionally reduced because it causes us to
				"inflate our minds until we forget our bodies" as Luiz Rufino said. May rationalization reduce body
				awareness to the point of no longer being superior. The focus here is on body language, in this case, my
				suspicion, demonstrated above, investigates the movements of neglect of bodies, as being a strategy of
				colonialism and modern thought. However, I am also not going to dedicate myself to talking directly
				about these crimes in this text.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It's just that the body, for us, is not opposed to what you call the mind." - Frantz Fanon
			</p>

			<p>
			<p>
				With this, I conclude that the knowledge of the body, memory with all its vastness, gives us materials
				to create, dribble, invent, and free ourselves. In this way, dealing with the body as an episteme can
				refer both to the subjective knowledge of that experience lived internally to the broader structure of
				the body in relation to the world, which influences knowledge in a certain social cultural historical
				context. As the thinker Leda Maria Martins would say, "What is repeated in the body and voice is also an
				episteme".

				"Dance is the ideal medium for the intellect-body to perform its inventions. It is the perfect space for
				the creation of gestures: favorably permeable to the movements that inhabit the life going on inside the
				body and simultaneously willing to work them in plastic and expressive terms in an attempt to achieve
				aesthetic syntheses that can impact the senses and transcend the utilitarianism that saturates
				contemporary experiences–which so frequently subjugates the body." – Danilo de Miranda, "A living
				library of gestures"
